# PyroCMS Related Posts Plugin

The PyroCMS Related Posts plugin allows you to show a list of blog post headlines that use specified keywords. 

The idea behind this is that you can effortlessly add a small lex-based line of code to your pages to show posts that are tagged with related keywords.

So for example, if you wanted to show the 5 latest posts that use the keywords "news" and "technology", you would do this:

{{ related_posts:posts keywords="news,technology" maximum_posts="5" maximum_length="100" }}
